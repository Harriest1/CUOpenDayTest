# Requirements

## Goal of the project

**To improve the frontend usability and visual appeal of the open day site**. The frontend already pulls completed JSON data to populate the page, so no API modification or backend functionality is necessary. The project should ultimately satisfy the **client brief**: We are seeking to enhance the Open Day website to create a more engaging, accessible, and visually appealing experience for prospective students. The project will involve applying Cardiff University branding, enhancing the user interface and implementing a modern, responsive layout.

## Functional requirements

### CU Branding
CU colours found in Tailwind config. Use this and other CU pages as a reference point to incorporate better branding and visual styles that would create a more natural flow between pages on the CU website. 
### Enhanced UI
Make information more digestable and less cumbersome, with less bloat on the screen. This can be done by grouping events into a layout ie. horizontal, introducing filters and/or having further information on events displayed on click/hover. This would also make the page more 'engaging' as the user is provided the information they're curious about without being overloaded and potentially scrolling to locate a specific event. 
### Improved Accessibility
Further accessibility can be developed by using semantic HTML to improve screen reader usage, having alternative text on any images and complying with WCAG guidelines
### Improved Responsiveness
The page should function across devices and adapt to mobile/tablet/desktop screen sizes via CSS queries.
